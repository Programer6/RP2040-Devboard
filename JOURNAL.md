## 10/3/2025 - Made the schematic from the guide!  

From the guide, I learned how each part of a schematic work for making the RP240 devboard! 
I placed each component, added labels for the pins, and connected power and ground lines where needed.

While doing this, I started brainstorming additional features I could include, like extra LEDs or sensors to make more then the guide it self
